# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
I was tasked by Pewlett Hackard with assisting HR in finding upcoming retirees and employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program. To complete this request we executed the following:

1. Created a table with the number of retiring employees by title. 
2. Created a table with the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program by birthdate. 

## Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- PostgreSQL 11, pgAdmin 4

## Results
- There are a total of 133,776 employees ready to retire at Pewlett Hackard. 
- There are a large number of senior titles opening when the employees retire, leaving 57,670 spots to be filled. 
- 14,221 Lead Engineering positions will need to be filled. 
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Summary
The majority of retirees hold senior positions at Pewlett Hackard. Engineers make up a large portion of retirees as well, at 15,982 (1761 of which are Assistant Engineers.) 12,242 Staff members will need to be replaced as well as 4,502 Tecnical Leaders. The title with the fewest retirees is Manager, at 2 people.
